## Lightning Talks

Speaker Lineup:

- Tyler Palesano - Overview of Visual Studio Code
- Carmen Long - Getting coding on a Raspberry Pi in 5 minutes

If you would like to give a 5-15 minute lightning talk, contact the group organizers through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OKC-Sharp), email ([organizers@okcsharp.net](organizers@okcsharp.net)), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/okcsharp), or the [Techlahoma Slack](http://www.techlahoma.org/spaces)!

This is a great way to give your first talk without the pressure of preparing a longer presentation!
