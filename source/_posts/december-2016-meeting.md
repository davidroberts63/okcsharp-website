## Help Make 2017 Great
Come join us Monday December 5th where we will have an open round-table discussion about making 2017 our best year yet. Bring your ideas for speaker topics, technical workshops, or anything that will help us bring value to our members.

There is **NO** OKC# without it's awesome members, so come out and help us make this group the best it can be.

This will also be a great time to network with other developers and see what others are doing in our communtiy.
