This month will be lightning talks and has been deferred one week to the 10th!

### Location moved back to Prototek

Lightning talks are a fantastic way to introduce our community to developers and allow developers the capability to share their passion. Community members have 5-15 minutes to present on a topic relating to .NET development. We give preference to new speakers to help strengthen and grow our community.

If you would like to give a talk, please reach out to us!
