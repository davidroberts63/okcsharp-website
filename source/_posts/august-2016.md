## Diving Into the Core (.NET Core)
.NET Core is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios. 

This will be a guided tour that starts with the .NET Core and answers the why, how, and what. We will discuss how it fits in the overall ecosystem and touch on some of the application models that have been built on top of it.  

We will then build a simple .NET Core application and explore the new dotnet cli. We will also cover adding unit tests and running our application from the command line. After our code is written and tested we will add it to a remote repository and explore how easy it is to build and run on other operating systems.
