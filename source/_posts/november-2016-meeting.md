## NodeJS for .Net Developers
We can't write beautiful, dynamic, interactive websites and web apps without JavaScript, and we can't do much with JavaScript without learning NodeJS. This will be a gentle introduction to NodeJS made for people who mostly write C#. I'll guide you past some of the trickiest hurdles to understanding how NodeJS fits into the .Net ecosystem. Learn the answers to questions like:

- What is NodeJS?
- If I'm writing web apps in C# using ASP.Net MVC or ASP.Net Core, why do I need NodeJS?
- How do I get started using it?
- Does it coexist with my .Net code?
