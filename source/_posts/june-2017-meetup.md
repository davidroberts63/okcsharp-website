## F# with Aaron Krauss

<p>F# is a functional programming language that runs within the .NET framework. In this talk, we'll learn what it means to be a functional language and how F# ties this together with the rest of the .NET framework. Everything will be live-coded, so you'll get to see exactly how things work as they're coded out. This talk is very beginner friendly to both functional and .NET development alike - so come join us!</p> <p>

Aaron Krauss is a developer at Clevyr where he builds data-driven applications in Ruby, Javascript, Shell, and anything else awesome. He also blogs regularly, enjoys craft beer, has a cool dog, and has been dating someone for over 10 years.</p>
