## Slaying the Performance Dragon with Elasticsearch
Is your Performance Dragon hiding treasures like response time and fuzzy matching? Does your gear include a large database with a particularly large table with a particularly large amount of data? Has the dragon ever sat on your server and brought your entire system down? If so, come join us on an adventure!

In this talk, we will explore a real problem that was crippling performance for our production apps, as well as how we found and implemented a solution in .NET, using AWS and ElasticSearch.
