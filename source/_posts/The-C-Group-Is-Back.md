The C# Group is coming back to Oklahoma City. It aspires to be the place where fellow .Net Developers can learn and experience fellowship with other .Net developers in the OKC area.

Expect more updates forthcoming, including information about meeting times and upcoming speakers.

If you're interested in volunteering, contact Matthey Reily, Jesse Harlin, or Amanada Harlin.

We're excited to get started, and can't wait to see this awesome group thriving once again!
