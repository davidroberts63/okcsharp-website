## Lightning Talks!
Lightning talks are a fantastic way to introduce our community to developers and allow developers the capability to share their passion. Community members have 5-15 minutes to present on a topic relating to .NET development. We give preference to new speakers to help strengthen and grow our community.

Additional details are still being discussed, so more information will be forth coming. If you would like to participate contact us organizers@okcsharp.net
